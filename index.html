        <p>This library is a collection of common 2D collision detection tests. Hopefully
this saves you from the pain of hunting them down yourself, or trying to rip
them out of physics libraries.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re looking for further reading, you are hurting yourself if you don&#39;t
buy <a href="http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/">Real-Time Collision Detection</a>. It is easily the best purchase you could
make if you are learning about collision detection. There is also an excellent
<a href="http://www.realtimerendering.com/intersections.html">list of different algorithms here</a>.</p>
<p>The code is written in <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a>, but it&#39;s simple and should be easily
portable to your language of choice. If you just want to see the code, take
a look at <a href="https://github.com/noonat/intersect/blob/master/intersect.js">the compiled JS file</a>. It&#39;s stripped of comments and
fairly readable.</p>

        <p>Let&#39;s define a couple helpers that we&#39;ll use through the code.</p>

        
          <div class='highlight'><pre>root = <span class="built_in">exports</span> ? (this.intersect ?= {})

        <p>We&#39;ll also need a 2D point. We could just use a literal <code>{x: 0, y: 0}</code> object,
but you have to normalize and copy things quite a bit when doing collision
detection, so it makes things a bit more readable to formalize it as a class.</p>

        <h2 id="types-of-tests">Types of Tests</h2>

        
      
        
        <p>Collision and physics libraries generally assign things to two categories:
static objects at rest, and dynamic moving objects. Full physics libraries often
solve things in more complicated (and more efficient) ways, and optimize for
cases of many objects moving at once and colliding against one another.</p>
<p>But, for most simple 2D games, it&#39;s usually enough to do a collision test
between the object you&#39;re moving now (while moving it in the code), and the rest
of the world. The world for this type of game rarely contains so many objects
that this hurts your performance, and it makes the problem far easier to solve.
It also makes it easier to fine tune the physics system, which is often very
important for platformers.</p>
<p>As such, the functions in this code are all written for <em>static vs static</em> or
<em>moving vs static</em> object tests, to keep things simple.</p>
<h3 id="intersection-tests">Intersection Tests</h3>
<figure class="right">
  <img src="./docs/svg/box-intersection-test.svg" class="small"/>
  <figcaption>A intersects with B and needs to be pushed out</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Intersection tests are a <em>static vs static</em> test. They check whether two static
objects are overlapping. They have a boolean result (colliding or not), with a
vector which tells you how you could move the objects so that they&#39;re no longer
overlapping.</p>
<p>Intersection tests will return a Hit object when a collision occurs:</p>

        
          <div class='highlight'><pre>root.Hit = <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Hit</span></span>
  <span class="attribute">constructor</span>: <span class="function"><span class="params">(collider)</span> -&gt;</span>
    this.collider = collider
    this.pos = <span class="keyword">new</span> Point()
    this.delta = <span class="keyword">new</span> Point()
    this.normal = <span class="keyword">new</span> Point()</pre></div>
        
      
        
        <ul>
<li><strong>hit.pos</strong> is the point of contact between the two objects (or an
estimation of it, in some sweep tests).</li>
<li><strong>hit.normal</strong> is the surface normal at the point of contact.</li>
<li><strong>hit.delta</strong> is the overlap between the two objects, and is a vector that
can be added to the colliding object&#39;s position to move it back to a
non-colliding state.</li>
<li><strong>hit.time</strong> is only defined for segment and sweep intersections, and is
fraction from 0 to 1 indicating how far along the line the collision occurred.
(This is the <code>t</code> value for the line equation <code>L(t) = A + t * (B - A)</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sweep-tests">Sweep Tests</h3>
<p>Sweep tests are a <em>moving vs static</em> test. They take two objects, sweep one
along a line of movement, and determine when it first collides with the other
object along that path of movement.</p>
<figure class="right">
  <img src="./docs/svg/box-bad-intersection-test.svg" class="small"/>
  <figcaption>A intersects both B and C, and is incorrectly pushed <em>into</em> a bad state</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Normal intersection tests are helpful for static objects, but they aren&#39;t the
best choice to collide a moving object. If you are trying to collide an object
A against two objects, B and C, you can easily get into an ambigious situation
where the collision isn&#39;t as easy to resolve.</p>
<p>Our intersection tests can only determine what the best way to resolve a
collision with an object is for that one object, independent of any other
objects you want to collide with. This means that correcting for a collision
with object B moves you into a state where are colliding with object C, and
the same thing happens with object C.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use a sweep test to take the path of movement into account,
and stop objects from ever moving into other objects.</p>
<p>Sweep tests return a <code>Sweep</code> object:</p>

        
          <div class='highlight'><pre>root.Sweep = <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Sweep</span></span>
  <span class="attribute">constructor</span>:<span class="function"> -&gt;</span>
    this.hit = <span class="literal">null</span>
    this.pos = <span class="keyword">new</span> Point()
    this.time = <span class="number">1</span></pre></div>
        
      
        
        <ul>
<li><strong>sweep.hit</strong> is a Hit object if there was a collision, or null if not.</li>
<li><strong>sweep.pos</strong> is the furthest point the object reached along the swept path
before it hit something.</li>
<li><strong>sweep.time</strong> is a copy of <code>sweep.hit.time</code>, or 1 if the object didn&#39;t hit
anything during the sweep.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="axis-aligned-bounding-boxes">Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes</h2>

        
      
        
        <p>Axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) are bounding rectangles that do not rotate.
This means that their edges are always aligned with the main X and Y axes, which
makes collision detection much simpler. These examples specify an AABB via a
center point and box&#39;s half size for each axis (that is, the box&#39;s &quot;radius&quot; on
each axis).</p>

        
          <div class='highlight'><pre>root.AABB = <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">AABB</span></span>
  <span class="attribute">constructor</span>: <span class="function"><span class="params">(pos, half)</span> -&gt;</span>
    this.pos = pos
    this.half = half</pre></div>
        
      
        
        <p>The library has four axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) tests: AABB vs point,
AABB vs segment (raycast), AABB vs AABB, and AABB vs swept AABB.</p>
<h3 id="aabb-vs-point">AABB vs Point</h3>
<p>This test is very simple, but I&#39;ve included it for completeness. If a point is
behind all of the edges of the box, it&#39;s colliding. The function returns a Hit
object, or null if the two do not collide. <code>hit.pos</code> and <code>hit.delta</code> will be
set to the nearest edge of the box.</p>
<p>This code first finds the overlap on the X and Y axis. If the overlap is less
than zero for either, a collision is not possible. Otherwise, we find the
axis with the smallest overlap and use that to create an intersection point
on the edge of the box.</p>

        
          <div class='highlight'><pre>  <span class="attribute">intersectPoint</span>: <span class="function"><span class="params">(point)</span> -&gt;</span>
    dx = point.x - this.pos.x
    px = this.half.x - abs(dx)
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">null</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> px &lt;= <span class="number">0</span>

    dy = point.y - this.pos.y
    py = this.half.y - abs(dy)
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">null</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> py &lt;= <span class="number">0</span>

    hit = <span class="keyword">new</span> Hit(<span class="keyword">this</span>)
    <span class="keyword">if</span> px &lt; py
      sx = sign(dx)
      hit.delta.x = px * sx
      hit.normal.x = sx
      hit.pos.x = this.pos.x + (this.half.x * sx)
      hit.pos.y = point.y
    <span class="keyword">else</span>
      sy = sign(dy)
      hit.delta.y = py * sy
      hit.normal.y = sy
      hit.pos.x = point.x
      hit.pos.y = this.pos.y + (this.half.y * sy)
    <span class="keyword">return</span> hit</pre></div>
        
      
        
        <h3 id="aabb-vs-segment">AABB vs Segment</h3>
<p>Games use segment intersection tests all the time, for everything from line of
sight to checking whether a bullet hit a monster. This is the most complicated
of the four AABB tests, and is commonly known as a [slab test]. It finds the
time of the line&#39;s intersection with the near and far edges of each axis of the
AABB. If they overlap, the segment is intersecting. For further reading, I
recommend <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperGraph/raytrace/rtinter3.htm">IRT p.65,104</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~awilliam/box/">WilliamsEtAl05</a>.</p>
<p>The function calculates the collision times along the line for each edge of
the box. It returns a Hit object (with an extra <code>time</code> property), or null if
the two do not overlap. <code>paddingX</code> and <code>paddingY</code> will be added to the radius
of the bounding box, if specified.</p>

        
          <div class='highlight'><pre>  <span class="attribute">intersectSegment</span>: <span class="function"><span class="params">(pos, delta, paddingX=<span class="number">0</span>, paddingY=<span class="number">0</span>)</span> -&gt;</span></pre></div>
        
      
        
        <p>You might notice we haven&#39;t defined a segment argument. A segment from point
<code>A</code> to point <code>B</code> can be expressed with the equation <code>S(t) = A + t * (B - A)</code>,
for <code>0 &lt;= t &lt;= 1</code>. In this equation, <code>t</code> is the time along the line, or
percentage distance from <code>A</code> to <code>B</code>. Instead of formalizing the concept of a
segment, we use this equation and describe it it as a start <code>pos</code> and a <code>delta</code>
vector to the end of the line.</p>
<p>Next, we need to find the linear time at which point the segment intersects
with the box&#39;s near and far edges.</p>
<figure class="right">
  <img src="./docs/svg/box-near-far-x.svg" class="small"/>
  <figcaption>Near x is greater than far y</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure class="right">
  <img src="./docs/svg/box-near-far-y.svg" class="small"/>
  <figcaption>Near x is greater than far y</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What are the near and far edges? Well, in our examples to the right, the
direction of the segment is from the top left to the bottom right. This means
that the near edges of the box are the top and left edges, and the far edges of
the box are the bottom and right edges.</p>
<p>Note that the intersection points might not actually be on the box or the
segment. They will be at the intersection of the infinite lines of the box&#39;s
edges and the infinte line of the segment.</p>
<p>We can calculate this by subtracting the position of the edge from the segment&#39;s
start position, then dividing by the segment&#39;s delta. Scaling is done here using
multiplication instead of division to deal with floating point issues.</p>

        
          <div class='highlight'><pre>    scaleX = <span class="number">1.0</span> / delta.x
    scaleY = <span class="number">1.0</span> / delta.y
    signX = sign(scaleX)
    signY = sign(scaleY)
    nearTimeX = (this.pos.x - signX * (this.half.x + paddingX) - pos.x) * scaleX
    nearTimeY = (this.pos.y - signY * (this.half.y + paddingY) - pos.y) * scaleY
    farTimeX = (this.pos.x + signX * (this.half.x + paddingX) - pos.x) * scaleX
    farTimeY = (this.pos.y + signY * (this.half.y + paddingY) - pos.y) * scaleY</pre></div>
        
      
        
        <p>Now we have to compare these times to see if a collision is possible.</p>
<figure class="right">
  <img src="./docs/svg/box-outside.svg" class="small"/>
  <figcaption>Near x is greater than far y</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>If the closest time of collision on either axis is further than the far
time on the opposite axis, we can&#39;t be colliding.</strong> For instance, in the example
to the right, because the segment&#39;s infinite line intersected the infinite line
of the box&#39;s top edge, before it ever hit the line for the left edge, we know
the intersection occurred before the segment ever reached the box. We don&#39;t
need to do any more checks, because we know a collision isn&#39;t possible.</p>
<p>Otherwise, find the greater of the near times, and the lesser of the far times
&mdash; we want the times that got closest to the slab. We can check these two
times to determine whether the collision occurred on the segment.</p>
<figure class="right">
  <img src="./docs/svg/box-behind.svg" class="small"/>
  <figcaption>Behind the segment</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure class="right">
  <img src="./docs/svg/box-front.svg" class="small"/>
  <figcaption>In front of the segment</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If the <strong>near time is greater than or equal to 1</strong>, the line starts in front
of the nearest edge, but finishes before it reaches it. That is, it means it
further than a whole segment length away. If the <strong>far time is less than or
equal to 0</strong>, the line starts in front of the far side of the box, and points
away from the box.</p>

        
          <div class='highlight'><pre>    <span class="keyword">if</span> nearTimeX &gt; farTimeY <span class="keyword">or</span> nearTimeY &gt; farTimeX

      <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">null</span></pre></div>
        
      
        
        <p>If we&#39;ve gotten this far a collision of some sort is happening. If the near time
is greater than zero, the segment starts outside and is entering the box.
Otherwise, the segment starts inside the box, and is exiting it. If we&#39;re
entering the box, we can set the hit time to the near time, since that&#39;s the
point along the segment at which it collided. If it&#39;s inside, it&#39;s colliding at
the very starting of the line, so just set the hit time to zero.</p>

        <h3 id="aabb-vs-aabb">AABB vs AABB</h3>
<p>This test uses a <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/technique/tutorialA.html#section1">separating axis test</a>, which checks for overlaps between the
two boxes on each axis. If either axis is <em>not</em> overlapping, the boxes aren&#39;t
colliding.</p>
<p>The function returns a Hit object, or null if the two static boxes do not
overlap, and gives the axis of least overlap as the contact point. That is, it
sets <code>hit.delta</code> so that the colliding box will be pushed out of the nearest
edge. This can cause weird behavior for moving boxes, so you should use
<code>sweepAABB</code> instead for moving boxes.</p>
<p>This code is very similar to the <code>intersectPoint</code> function above.</p>

<p>Swept volume tests are awesome &mdash; they tell you whether object A hits
object B at any point along a movement path. This problem seems hard, until
someone tells you the magic word: <a href="http://physics2d.com/content/gjk-algorithm">Minkowski</a>. If you inflate the static box by
the size of the moving box, you can just test the movement <em>segment</em> against
the padded static box. The point at which the segment intersects the padded box
tells you where the moving box first collided with the static box.</p>
<p><code>sweepAABB</code> finds the intersection of this box and another moving box, where
the <code>delta</code> argument is a point describing the movement of the box. It returns
a Sweep object. <code>sweep.hit</code> will be a Hit object if the two collided, or
null if they did not overlap.</p>

        <p>Otherwise, call into <code>intersectSegment</code> instead, where the segment is the center
of the moving box, with the same delta. We pass the moving box&#39;s half size as
padding. If we get a hit, we need to adjust the hit pos. Since a segment vs box
test was used, the hit pos is the center of the box. This offsets it to the edge
of the box, along the segment of movement.</p>

        <h3 id="sweeping-an-aabb-through-multiple-objects">Sweeping an AABB Through Multiple Objects</h3>
<p>So, let&#39;s say we have an AABB we want to move from one point to another, without
allowing it to collide with a list of static AABBs. To do this, we need to call
<code>sweepAABB</code> on each static object, and keep track of the sweep that moved the
least distance &mdash; that is, the nearest collision to the start of the path.</p>

        
          <div class='highlight'><pre>  <span class="attribute">sweepInto</span>: <span class="function"><span class="params">(staticColliders, delta)</span> -&gt;</span>
    nearest = <span class="keyword">new</span> Sweep()
    nearest.time = <span class="number">1</span>
    nearest.pos.x = this.pos.x + delta.x
    nearest.pos.y = this.pos.y + delta.y
    <span class="keyword">for</span> collider <span class="keyword">in</span> staticColliders
      sweep = collider.sweepAABB(<span class="keyword">this</span>, delta)
      <span class="keyword">if</span> sweep.time &lt; nearest.time
        nearest = sweep
    <span class="keyword">return</span> nearest</pre></div>
        
      
        
        <p>It&#39;s a common use case to have a single object that needs to move through a
world, colliding with many other objects. Note that solving this problem
efficiently requires two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>A broad phase, which does not do precise collision detection, but which can
very quickly reject large chunks of the world which are not likely to be
colliding. That is, you don&#39;t have to try to calculate how two objects are
colliding if you know they&#39;re in entirely different rooms.</li>
<li>A narrow phase, which finds, given a set of items which are likely to be
colliding, the earliest point at which the moving object collided with one
of the items.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is out of scope for this library, but these tests are great for
solving the narrow phase. You can usually get away without a broad phase for
simple games, however, if you aren&#39;t colliding against a huge number of objects.</p>
